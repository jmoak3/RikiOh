Rikinfection is a challenging, asymetrical multiplayer game for 5 or more players. 

At 0:00, one player is randomly chosen to be Riki while the rest are Snipers. 
The Snipers must defend themselves and their ancient against the Rikis for 10 minutes.

If a Sniper falls to a Riki, the Sniper will respawn as a Riki on the opposite team! 

Buy wards, salves, and other items to help defend... or to hunt!

Are you and your fellow Snipers coordinated enough to survive? 

The stats and abilities of the characters have been altered for balance.
